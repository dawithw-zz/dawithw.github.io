<h1>Hello</h1>

This is my online cv/portfolio website. 

I used only HTML, CSS, and Javascript with JQuery.

I wanted to build something from scratch without relying on pre-built themes or frameworks like Bootstrap. It was a great learning opportunity, but quite the time sink.
As someone who mostly works on the logical side of application development, this was a completely different playground.

In terms of difficulty I faced:   
Design >>> CSS > HTML > Javascript
